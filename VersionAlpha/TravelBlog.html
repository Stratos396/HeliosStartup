		<h1>Day 3 of Singapore: Birds</h1>
	<p1>
Today was interesting to say the least.

			<h1>Day 2 of Singapore: Friends</h1>
				<p1>
				I now have time to relax and write another post, while there is nothing
				that I really have to do.<br />
				Today, Mum and I woke up at 7:36 to go to McDonalds for breakfast. As it
				turns out, they don't have what we call a "Hotcakes Meal". They have a number
				of breakfasts, all of which did not incude pancakes <i>and</i> a hash brown.
				If they did, they had things like egg as well. This made me a very saddened.<br />
				Thanks, Mum for asking them for "pancakes and a hashbrown"!<br />
					<br>
				So, after that, I showed Mum the way back to the hotel (again!), where we stayed in
				the robby for about ten minutes to wait for for Wendy and Ethan.<br>
				Eventually, when they arrived, they took us to the Artscience Museum. Personally,
				I don't think it was really worth it...<br>
				After that, they took use to the garden in the sky. Basically it is a garden,
				but suspended on top of building, 56 storys in the sky! Mum got extremely dizzy,
				Ethan was bored, I was taking lots of photos. When Wendy asked me to take
				a photo of her with Ethan and Shona, apparently accidentally having people
				close to the very far edge of the screen is something worth criticising me
				for, even when you could just crop it out. <br>
				<br>
				After that, they dropped us at the hotel, where I started on JavaScript and
				Mum slept. At about 6:40, we headed downstairs to catch a cab to their place
				to have dinner. We stayed there for a bit, had dinner, then Ethan and I
				went to his room to play some TF2. After about 2 hours, we had to leave.<br>
				<br>
				We came back home, I did some more javascript, and then went to bed. <br>

			<h1><b>Day 1 of Singapore:</b> Shopping</h1>
				<p1>
					So yeah, today wasn't great. I spent most of my time inside a shopping centre called
					"RafflesCity". I didn't have a fun time walking around it. It is pretty big and has
					lots of shops, though.<br>
					We attempted to buy some clothes for me, but the fashion sense here is completely
					different to that of Australia's. Anywhere we went, I couldn't seem to find clothes I
					liked the look of. They were all either too colourful, too patterned or too bland.
					We didn't end up getting any. <br>
					<br>
				Also, since we are in the northern hemisphere, Mum's sense of direction has just
				run out of battery like my phone and computer did. The entire time, I was pointing
				out where we were and where to go, because she couldn't find anything.<br />
			Additionally, we went to Hardly Normal (Harvey Norman) and got some adaptors. I was
			able to charge my computer and my phone! I had some sort of contact with the outside
			world! Woo!<br>
			<br>
			Tomorrow we are getting breakfast at McDonals, so I have to wake up at 7:30 AM.
		For some reason, my body seems to have adjusted to the change in time zones very
		well. I am glad about that.<br>
		Anyway, can't stay up too late writing this recap, so now I say goodnight!<br />

		<h1><b>Day 0 of Singapore:</b> The Flight</h1>
		<p1>
		Currently I am on my way to Singapore, flying over Australia. It'll be like...
		11pm Australian time when we get there... I think. I actually wasn't aware we were
		 going there until monday, so I have had very short notice. As I am writing this, we
		 are somewhere over a desert. I am watching the Grand Budapest Hotel.<br>
		 I have not had any time to update any of my packs, unfortunately. I really wish I could.
		 Fortunately for me, I have started work on "Helios Overhaul" which will be a complete pack,
		 rather than one like Tweaks.
		 	<br><br>
		 In my limited journey over Australia so far, I have seen some interesting terrain.
		 Things like ridges, mountains, "tiny little bumps in the earth", dunes, towns, farms,
		 etc. It is really quite interesting, though admittedly I am a little scared.
		 Primarily that my computer will run out of battery. Also that I'm in a plane.
		 I really don't like flying.
		 <br><br>
		 We also have no toothpaste. They confiscated it at the airport because it was a
		 liquid over 100 milligrams. Mum's really pissed off at them. Where are we going to
		 get toothpaste at ten o'clock at night in Singapore?!
		 	<br /><br />
		 My complaints for now:<br />
		 There is a baby who just <i>won't shut <b>up!!!11!!!!1</b></i><br />
		 I am in a plane.<br />
		 There is still like 5 more hours before we get there.<br />
		 My phone is out of battery.<br />
		 Did I mention I'm in a plane?<br />
		 I have no access to internet.<br />
		 My computer is on %60 battery.<br />
		 The people in front of me keep adjusting their seat which keeps squashing my laptop.<br />
		 My TV keeps freezing.<br />
			 <br /><br />
		 I will write more as I get more frustrated because, let's face it, I inevitably will.
			 <br /><br />
		 That's all that has happened so far.<br />
		 For now I have nothing more to say. Lucky you ;)<br />
